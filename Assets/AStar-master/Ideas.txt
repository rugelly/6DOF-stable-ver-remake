- Use nodes and edges in the algorithm to make it more flexible
- Block nodes by removing connections (making pathfinding truly cheaper)
- Implement 'corner cutting' by removing more edges around a blocked node
- Use improvments from TrafficSim for MinHeap

- Rewrite the minheap: store nodes in a list<> instead of a fake linked list this will also prevent circular loops between min heap nodes
